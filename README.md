## Discord Bot | Calculator + Stock Check


 This bot utilizes two key functionalities. The first is an integrated calculator capable of performing basic calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and more.
 The second functionality involves two commands that allow us to check and update the stock quantity of any product we choose to display. For this example, 
 I used gold and RuneScape memberships (RuneScape is a very popular massively multiplayer online game).

**The stock command**

by simply typing "!stock" sends an image to the discord channel where it shows the current stock quantity,

However, we can use a second slash command called **"stock_update"** this is used to update the current stock numbers on the displayed product,

Here we enter 350 million gold and 100 memberships, which when writing the command !stock we are shown the image with the updated quantities

Now we can also do the opposite, if we want to mark both products as out of stock, we simply write "0"

![2024-09-06 20_51_46-Window](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9df0314-c9fb-40fa-bb1c-91a4de280473)

Finally, the image will update and say "Out" instead of the quantity, and will also mark it with an X
