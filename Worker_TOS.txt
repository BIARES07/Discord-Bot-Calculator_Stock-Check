1. The server will charge a fixed tax of 30% on each successfully completed order payment.
2. You must use RuneLite exclusively and send daily updates (experience gained, quests, achievements, kill counts, etc.) with full RuneLite screenshots, including all plugins. Nothing can be cropped. You should also mark your login and logout times with screenshots so that the customer is aware of your activity.
3. You are not allowed to initiate private services with customers. If we discover that you are doing this, you will be automatically dismissed.
4. You must provide us with your Sythe profile and include your Discord username in the profile status. You must maintain this while working with us (without this, you cannot work with us). If you don't have a profile, you can quickly create one from this link: [Sythe Registration](https://www.sythe.org/login/login?r=465503).
5. We understand that this can be challenging for many, but we encourage you to be friendly and communicative with the customer during any service. This includes greeting them at the start of the order, answering their questions, and speaking fluently and assertively. We also recommend precise delivery times, as this enhances the customer's perception of you and the server. If you perform well, you'll enjoy significant benefits such as reduced server taxes and exclusive jobs.
6. The minimum deposit starts with an equivalent of 300M for working with us.
7. You must avoid any complaints or dissatisfaction from customers during ongoing services.
8. You are 100% responsible for any damage caused to a customer's account, such as wealth loss, status loss (HCIM, PURE, Zeker), or bans due to macros. For any such damage, we will use your deposit to compensate the customer, and in some cases (depending on severity), you may be dismissed.
9. We reserve the right to make changes to our worker terms of service at any time. Therefore, if you work with us, you must accept any updates.
10. Any violation of the established rules may result in fines or expulsion from ongoing orders, or even termination.
